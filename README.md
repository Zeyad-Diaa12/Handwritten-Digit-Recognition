# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project demonstrates the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using deep learning techniques. The project uses the MNIST dataset to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that accurately classifies images of handwritten digits.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Loads and explores the MNIST dataset.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalizes and reshapes the image data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Building:** Constructs a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Trains the model, evaluates its performance on a test set, and visualizes training metrics.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots for loss/accuracy curves and sample predictions to better understand model behavior.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras jupyter
